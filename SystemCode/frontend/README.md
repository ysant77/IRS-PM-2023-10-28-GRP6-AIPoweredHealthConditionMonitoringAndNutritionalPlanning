## Frontend server setting up and starting (in develop mode)

0. Node.js is required. [Download here.](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

   Check installation using:

```
npm -v
```

1. Under this directory, run the following command in console to install required node packages.

   A directory called `node_modules` should appear once the installation succeeded. (Size is around 90+ MiB)

```
npm i
```
2. After installed packages, run this to start the server.

```
npm run dev
```
3. visit `localhost:3000` using browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended).

## Note:

Due to the optimized loading method of Vite, web pages may malfunction when loaded for first. Revisiting/reloading the pages should solve the problem.
