## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Traditional healthcare services often adopt a one-size-fits-all approach with limited medical support available only during infrequent appointments scheduled months apart.
Additionally, studies have been done to substantiate the need for good follow-up care with timely access to medical conditions and information could lead to better recoveries.
Thereby, we aim to create an AI-Powered Health Condition Monitoring and Nutrition Planning system to enable a tailored health journey catering uniquely to the Userâ€™s needs and provide a wealth of personalised resources to accompany the User throughout the recovery journey.
